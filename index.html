                        <p> <h3>Donating blood is a humanitarian act because it contributes to saving the lives of 
                            thousands of patients who suffer from health problems and need blood transfusion on a weekly or monthly
                             basis, such as patients with kidney failure, leukemia, bean anemia, and other diseases. Among them may be the elderly or
                              children who are unable to find donors, as specialists have proven. In a study of the problem of blood bags and reserve shortages, 
                              the annual available blood bags cover only one-third (30%) of the patients’ actual need.
                             Anemia is considered one of the most common blood diseases in the world. There are about20% of maternal deaths 
                             are due to anemia, and the World Health Organization indicated that about a third of the world’s population suffers 
                             from anemia (2014)
                             The World Health Organization confirmed that Egypt is among 120 countries with unsafe blood storage systems. What is worrying 
                             is that every three seconds there is a person in need of a blood transfusion, and one out of every ten patients admitted to the hospital
                              needs a blood transfusion.
                             Egyptians need 2.5 to 3 million bags of blood annually, while only 800,000 blood bags are obtained. </h2></p>

                            <h2 > Background Research</h2><h3>
                                The human body contains five liters of blood on average, and the amount of blood donated is estimated at about 450 milliliters of blood. This represents only 8% of the average blood volume of an adult, and it does not affect the normal activity of the blood donor at all.
                                In low-income countries, children under the age of five receive blood transfusions at a rate of up to 54%The group of patients over the age of 60 years in high-income countries constitutes the group to which blood is most often transfused, and which is affected by a rate of up to 76% of all blood deficiency operations.
                                Hence, the World Health Organization has set standards for honorary blood donation, which are:
                                Take specific steps to select donors, including a pre-donation form and a medical examination every time you donate
                                Examine all blood units to ensure they are free of blood-borne viruses
                                The optimal use of blood, and therefore we must know the types of blood donation
                                1- Whole blood: This is the most common type in blood donation operations
                                2-Platelets
                                3-Plasma
                                
                                4-Red blood cells
                                Conditions for donating blood:
                                1- The donor must be in good health and not suffering from any contagious diseases
                                2- The donor’s age must be between 18-65 years
                                3-The donor’s weight must not be less than 50 kg
                                4- The hemoglobin level for men should be 14-17 grams and for women it should be 12-14 grams.
                                5- The pulse should be between 50-100 per minute
                                6- The blood pressure should be less than 80-120 mm Hg

                    <h2>Research Summary:</h2>
                    <p><h3> Blood donation: It is a voluntary medical procedure in which blood or one of its components is transferred from a healthy person to a sick person who needs blood. This procedure is needed by millions of people annually.
                        The goal of this research is to find a number of donors quickly and easily when blood is needed in emergency situationsIt is known that there is an actual shortage of blood or its derivatives, and the patient faces difficulty in finding donors
                        Therefore, I created an application on the mobile phone for collecting donors and providing all blood types. Communication between patients and donors is done through a database that was recorded in a form that is filled out by either the patient or the donor, which contains the name, address, blood type, and the location of the hospital in which the patient is located.
                        A list was made of the names of the banks located in each governorate and how to reach them through a location to determine the location
                        I created a page on the social networking site Facebook for the research idea, which is located on this page  Information about the idea, such as @how to join and donate, @types of blood types, @the specific period for re-donating again, and another group of information, and we added a contact number to it.
                        With the provision of these features and data, it is noted that a large portion of the time wasted in finding a donor, finding the same species, and other problems that patients suffer from was inevitably saved. Communication became easy and in less time, and we all know that the time factor is a very important factor for patients in cases of critical surgery or accidents. Dangerous methods: I wanted to be a simple factor
                         in solving this problem that poses a threat to the lives of many patients

   <h3>                    
 
    Ease of communication between the patient and the donor in the shortest possible time
    Forming a database on the application to speed up communication by adding a location to determine the location of the presence of both parties
    Reducing the time to reach patients so that the patient can be quickly rescued in critical cases
